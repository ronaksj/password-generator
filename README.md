# password-generator
- Strong and complex password is required in every websites and applications thus I made a password-generator using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
- Here I used different character sets to create combinational strong password.
- The User can choose length of the paswword between 4 to 20 (10 characters are recommanded) to generate specific password.
- Also user can select 1 or more options from 4 options wheteher he/she want to:
   1) Include Uppercase latters
   2) Include Lowercase latters
   3) Include numbers
   4) Include symbols
- The User will get 2 different passwords with same length as per user input.
- I also created Copy functionality which copies the password to the clipboard.
